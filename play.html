        <pre> COTTON. But you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
            reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
            fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.
            
            BETTY. [_Thoughtfully._] Truly reverend and most serious, father
            [_looking up roguishly_], but I like not so much of the grave about it.
            
            COTTON. [_Continuing._] I fear thou lookest upon the matter too lightly.
            It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly.
            
            BETTY. [_Protesting._] Nay, father, why consider it at all? Marriage is
            yet a great way off. Mayhap I shall never leave thee.
            
            COTTON. Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
            _thee_. The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow,
            for we know not what a day may bring forth.
            
            BETTY. [_Dropping her knitting._] Father, thou art not feeling well.
            Perhaps----
            
            COTTON. Nay, child, be not alarmed. 'Tis but a most necessary lesson to
            be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
            I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
            go.
            
            BETTY. [_Picking her knitting up._] Be comfortably assured, then, I
            prithee; I have no fears.
            
            COTTON. [_Bringing his arm down forcibly on the arm of the chair._] Aye!
            There it is. Thou hast no fears. Would that thou had'st some! [_Looks up
            at the portrait._] Had thy prudent and virtuous mother only lived to
            point the way, I might be spared this anxiety; but, beset by diverse
            difficulties in establishing the kingdom of God in this country, and
            sorely harassed by many hardships and by evil men, I fear me I have not
            propounded to thee much that I ought.
            
            BETTY. In what then is mine education lacking? Have I not all that is
            fitting and proper for a maiden to know?
            
            COTTON. [_Perplexed._] I know not. I have done my best, but thou hast
            not the proper attitude of mind befitting a maiden about to enter the
            married estate.
            
            BETTY. [_Protesting._] Nay, but I am not about to enter the married
            estate.
            
            COTTON. It is time.
            
            BETTY. [_Mockingly pleading._] Entreat me not to leave thee, father, nor
            forsake thee; for whither thou goest I will go, and whither----
            
            COTTON. [_Interrupting sternly._] Betty! It ill befitteth a daughter of
            mine to quote the Scriptures with such seeming irreverence.--I would not
            be parted from thee, yet I would that thou wert promised to some godly
            and upright soul that would guide thee yet more surely in the paths of
            righteousness. There be many such.
            
            BETTY. Yea, too many.
            
            COTTON. What meanest thou?
            
            BETTY. One were one too many when I would have none.
            
            COTTON. [_Shaking his head._] Ah. Betty, Betty! When wilt thou be
            serious? There is a goodly youth among the friends surrounding thee whom
            I have often marked, both on account of his godly demeanor and simple
            wisdom.
            
            BETTY. [_Nodding._] Yea, simple.</pre>
