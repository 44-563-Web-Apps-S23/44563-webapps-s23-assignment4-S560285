        <pre> <h6>COTTON.</h6> But you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
            reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
            fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.
            
            <h6>BETTY.</h6> [_Thoughtfully._] Truly reverend and most serious, father
            [_looking up roguishly_], but I like not so much of the grave about it.
            
            <h6></h6>COTTON.</h6> [_Continuing._] I fear thou lookest upon the matter too lightly.
            It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly.
            
           <h6>BETTY.</h6> [_Protesting._] Nay, father, why consider it at all? Marriage is
            yet a great way off. Mayhap I shall never leave thee.
            
            <h6>COTTON.</h6> Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
            _thee_. The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow,
            for we know not what a day may bring forth.
            
            <h6>BETTY.</h6> [_Dropping her knitting._] Father, thou art not feeling well.
            Perhaps----
            
            <h6>COTTON.</h6> Nay, child, be not alarmed. 'Tis but a most necessary lesson to
            be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
            I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
            go.
            
            <h6>BETTY.</h6> [_Picking her knitting up._] Be comfortably assured, then, I
            prithee; I have no fears.
            
            <h6></h6>COTTON.</h6> [_Bringing his arm down forcibly on the arm of the chair._] Aye!
            There it is. Thou hast no fears. Would that thou had'st some! [_Looks up
            at the portrait._] Had thy prudent and virtuous mother only lived to
            point the way, I might be spared this anxiety; but, beset by diverse
            difficulties in establishing the kingdom of God in this country, and
            sorely harassed by many hardships and by evil men, I fear me I have not
            propounded to thee much that I ought.
            
            <h6>BETTY.</h6> In what then is mine education lacking? Have I not all that is
            fitting and proper for a maiden to know?
            
            <h6>COTTON.</h6> [_Perplexed._] I know not. I have done my best, but thou hast
            not the proper attitude of mind befitting a maiden about to enter the
            married estate.
            
            <h6>BETTY.</h6> [_Protesting._] Nay, but I am not about to enter the married
            estate.
            
            <h6>COTTON.</h6> It is time.
            
            <h6>BETTY.</h6> [_Mockingly pleading._] Entreat me not to leave thee, father, nor
            forsake thee; for whither thou goest I will go, and whither----
            
            <h6>COTTON.</h6> [_Interrupting sternly._] Betty! It ill befitteth a daughter of
            mine to quote the Scriptures with such seeming irreverence.--I would not
            be parted from thee, yet I would that thou wert promised to some godly
            and upright soul that would guide thee yet more surely in the paths of
            righteousness. There be many such.
            
            <h6>BETTY.</h6> Yea, too many.
            
            COTTON. What meanest thou?
            
            <h6>BETTY.</h6> One were one too many when I would have none.
            
            <h6>COTTON.</h6> [_Shaking his head._] Ah. Betty, Betty! When wilt thou be
            serious? There is a goodly youth among the friends surrounding thee whom
            I have often marked, both on account of his godly demeanor and simple
            wisdom.
            
            <h6>BETTY.</h6> [_Nodding._] Yea, simple.</pre>
