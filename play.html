         <P class="speech">you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
            reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
            fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.</P>
            
            <h6 class=" BETTY">BETTY.</h6>
            <P class = "direction">[_Thoughtfully._]</P><P class = "speech">Truly reverend and most serious, father
            [_looking up roguishly_], but I like not so much of the grave about it.</P>

            It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly.</P>

            <P class = "direction">[_Protesting._]</P><P class = "speech"> Nay, father, why consider it at all? Marriage is
            yet a great way off. Mayhap I shall never leave thee.</P>

            <P class="speech">Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
            _thee_. The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow,
            for we know not what a day may bring forth.</P>

            <P class="speech"> Nay, child, be not alarmed. 'Tis but a most necessary lesson to
            be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
            I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
            go.</P>

            There it is. Thou hast no fears. Would that thou had'st some! [_Looks up
            at the portrait._] Had thy prudent and virtuous mother only lived to
            point the way, I might be spared this anxiety; but, beset by diverse
            difficulties in establishing the kingdom of God in this country, and
            sorely harassed by many hardships and by evil men, I fear me I have not
            propounded to thee much that I ought.</P>

            not the proper attitude of mind befitting a maiden about to enter the
